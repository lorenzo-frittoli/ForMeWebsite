# ForMe Website

**VERSION 1.0 OUT NOW. ALL BASIC FEATURES ARE IMPLEMENTED.**

Website for [ForMe](https://www.liceocassini.it/pages/forme.php), a yearly event at [Liceo Cassini](https://www.liceocassini.it/) highschool.

This website supports booking activities with limited availability, on multiple days, over multiple timespans of variable length.

There is a "Me" page, detailing all the activities one has booked.

It features different days for different types of users (ei: students and guests).

It supports randomly filling the unbooked timespans in a user's schedule.
